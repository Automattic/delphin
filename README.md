# Delphin

Delphin is a place where you register a single domain in the easiest way.

It’s built with JavaScript – a very light [node](https://nodejs.org) server, [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), and many other wonderful libraries.

### Getting started

1. Make sure you have `git`, `node`, and `npm` installed
2. Clone this repository locally: `git@github.com:Automattic/delphin.git`
3. Install packages and start the server with `npm start`
4. Open `localhost:1337` in your browser
