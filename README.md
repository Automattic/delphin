# Delphin

Delphin is a place where you register a single domain in the easiest way.

It’s built with JavaScript – a very light [node](https://nodejs.org) server, [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), and many other wonderful libraries.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have `git`, `node` (v4.4.3), and `npm` installed
2. Clone this repository locally: `git@github.com:Automattic/delphin.git`
3. Install packages and start the server with `npm start`
4. Add `127.0.0.1 delphin.localhost` to your hosts file
5. Open `delphin.localhost:1337` in your browser

## Coding Guidelines

For now, our coding guidelines mirror [Calypso's guidelines](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines.md).

## Browser Support

We support the latest two versions of all major browsers, except IE, where we currently only support 11 and Edge (see [Browse Happy](http://browsehappy.com) for current latest versions).
